        <p class="about-content">
            I was born and raised at Lake Tahoe, California and growing up I have always had a passion for video games, sports, and technology. At the age of 16 I decided my dream was to become a game developer.
            This lead me to enroll in the Computer Science and Engineering program at the University of Nevada-Reno. I am now a few months away from receiveing my CSE degree with a minor in Math and now looking for my dream job of becoming a game developer.

            After attending many CS classes I have realized my passion in CS is in Graphics, Engine Architecture, and Design. In graphics, I have experince in OpenGL and GLSL including lighting and physics I am also currently getting practice with DirectX
            and HLSL programming. In Game Engine Architecture, I have created a small engine for my graphics projects as well as created an engine utilizing the OGRE graphics engine. I also love to play around with new engines currently I am using Amazons
            Lumberyard to create some levels, but I have also used Unity and Unreal to create some projects in 2D, 3D, and VR. In Design, I have created a different types of games and levels in Unity. Most of the work I have designed levels in have been 2D
            with my original art, but am currently Working on 3D level in Unity with VR and a 3D level with my engine built with OGRE.

                This is my final project for my Graphics class. We were givin the option to create anything we could think of, so we made a marbles game demonstrating fragment lighting, model loading, physics, and textures. This is all done with C++/OpenGL in a two person group.
                Lighting was my favorite aspect of the course so we wanted to make that the main feature of the project.
