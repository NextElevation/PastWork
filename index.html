        <p>
            Hello my name is Jake Lahr and I love all things video games! Whether its playing them, developing them, or watching them. I can't get enough video games.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently getting my degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Nevada-Reno. I will graduate this May and I am currently looking for a full-time position.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to developing games and programming I have found out that I really enjoy graphics and shader programming. I also enjoy game engine architecture, level design, and playing around with any game engine I can get my hands on.
