        <p>
            Hello my name is Jake Lahr and I love all things video games! Whether its playing them, developing them, or watching them. I can't get enough video games.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently getting my degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Nevada-Reno. I will graduate this May and I am currently looking for a full-time position.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to developing games and programming I have found out that I really enjoy graphics and shader programming. I also enjoy game engine architecture, level design, and playing around with any game engine I can get my hands on.

        <h2 class="work">My current and past projects</h2>
        <p>
            Below are some examples of my current projects I am still working on and past projects that I have done in school or on my own time.
        </p>
        <h3>Marbles</h3>
        <video width="800" height="600" controls loop>

        </video>
        <p>
            This is my final project for my Graphics class. We were givin the option to create anything we could think of, so we made a marbles game demonstrating fragment lighting, model loading, physics, and textures. This is all done with C++/OpenGL in a two person group.
            Lighting was my favorite aspect of the course so we wanted to make that the main feature of the project.
